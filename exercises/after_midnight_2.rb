# As seen in the previous exercise, the time of day can be represented as the
# number of minutes before or after midnight. If the number of minutes is
# positive, the time is after midnight. If the number of minutes is negative,
# the time is before midnight.
#
# Write two methods that each take a time of day in 24 hour format, and return
# the number of minutes before and after midnight, respectively. Both methods
# should return a value in the range 0..1439.
#
# You may not use ruby's Date and Time methods.
