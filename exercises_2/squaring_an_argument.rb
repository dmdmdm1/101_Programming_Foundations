#
# Using the multiply method from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write a
# method that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of
# multiplying a number by itself).
#
# Example:
#
# square(5) == 25
# square(-8) == 64

def square(num)
  num * num
end

puts square(5) == 25
puts square(-8) == 64
